Each episode features an interview with an ambitious builder or deep thinker on a topic, from art to geopolitics and from healthcare to education.These conversations also showcase another kind of guest: AI. Whether it&#039;s Inflection&rsquo;s Pi, OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT or other AI tools, each episode will use AI to enhance and advance our discussion about what humanity could possibly get right if we leverage technology&mdash;and our collective effort&mdash;effectively",
